complicated to transform current stderr (Log::Log4perl) to YAML:
	- different formats for SBML errors/warnings and my errors/warnings
		=> must keep the SBML format people "know"
and still be one warning/error per line for terminals

Add InChI/InChIKey and SMILES in SBML, but they need to be written in the TSV files
(+RInChI ...)

Add links to UniProt, if any, as gene annotation
